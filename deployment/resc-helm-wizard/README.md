## Testing
[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)

### Run unit tests, linting and import checks locally:
See below commands for running various (unit/linting) tests locally. To run these tests you need to install [tox](https://pypi.org/project/tox/). This can be done on Linux and Windows with Git Bash.

Run below commands to make sure that the unit tests are running and that the code matches quality standards:
```bash
pip install tox      # install tox locally

tox -v -e sort       # Run this command to validate the import sorting
tox -v -e lint       # Run this command to lint the code according to this repository's standard
tox -v -e pytest     # Run this command to run the unit tests
tox -v               # Run this command to run all of the above tests
```
