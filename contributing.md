# Contributing

Hi! Let's innovate together! We are entusiastic that you'd like to contribute to our projects. Together we build the future of finance and IT. 

Contributions to this project are released to the public under the project's open source license.

Please note that this project is released with a [Contributor Code of Conduct](https://github.com/ABNAMRO/repository-scanner/blob/main/code-of-conduct.md). By participating in this project you agree to abide by its terms.

## Contributing tips
### Make sure your idea is unique
Before doing anything, do a quick check to make sure your idea hasn’t been discussed elsewhere. Skim the project’s README, issues (open and closed), mailing list, and Stack Overflow. You don’t have to spend hours going through everything, but a quick search for a few key terms goes a long way.

If you can’t find your idea elsewhere, you’re ready to make a move. 

### Respect community decisions. 
Your ideas may differ from the community’s priorities or vision. Community may offer feedback or decide not to pursue your idea. While you should discuss and look for compromise, maintainers have to live with your decision longer than you will. If you disagree with their direction, you can always work on your own fork or start your own project.

Here are a few things you can do that will increase the likelihood of your pull request being accepted:

- Follow standards for style and code quality
- Write tests.
- Keep your change as focused as possible. If there are multiple changes you would like to make that are not dependent upon each other, consider submitting them as separate pull requests.
- Write a [good commit message](http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html).
